# SnipQuest

**SnipQuest** is a simple yet powerful Python-based application that allows users to snip a portion of their screen, extract text from the image using OCR, and query a Large Language Model (LLM) to get relevant answers. With an intuitive interface built using Tkinter, SnipQuest makes it easy to capture on-screen text and receive instant insights.

## Features
- **Snipping Tool**: Easily capture a selected region of your screen using the "Start Snipping" button.
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: Extract text from the snipped image using Tesseract OCR.
- **LLM-Powered Answers**: Ask questions about the extracted text and receive answers from an integrated LLM, such as OpenAI GPT.

## How It Works
1. Launch the application and click the "Start Snipping" button.
2. Select the area of the screen you want to capture.
3. The application extracts the text from the selected area.
4. The extracted text is sent to an LLM for processing, and an answer is returned.
